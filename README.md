# UBISOFT GAMEJAM 2017
Game about cute kitten-assassin. Yep, assassin;)

Theme was "Inverse control and lootboxes". 
So in our game you control kitten via laser pointer. 
In epic boss fight at the end of game your weapon is lootboxes. 

Good approach was to break connection between scenes, so in development stage you can just start current scene and not to go to main menu, then select level and only after that, test what you want.
